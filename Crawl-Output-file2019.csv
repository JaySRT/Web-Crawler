This was done in a retrospective study of the medical records of 30 patients with MPS I (n=13), MPS II (n=9) and MPS VI (n=8) who were being treated with enzyme replacement therapy. As part of routine nutritional monitoring, Se levels were measured, revealing that 28 patients (93.3%) had values below the normal range. Therefore, they received supplementation for 12 months, and Se was measured after 6 and 12 months. Glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity, total glutathione (GSHt), oxidized glutathione (GSSG) and reduced glutathione (GSH) were measured at baseline and 6 months after Se supplementation. The mean GSHt at baseline was 7.90 ± 2.36 µmol/g Hb, and after Se supplementation it was 5.76 ± 1.13 µmol/g Hb; GSH/GSSG was 2.3 ± 1.16 at baseline and 0.58 ± 0.38 after supplementation. GPx activity was 16.46 ± 3.31 U/g Hb at baseline and 4.53 ± 4.92 U/g Hb after Se supplementation. The difference was shown to be statistically significant by paired t-test. In conclusion, our study demonstrated that oxidative stress parameters were altered by Se supplementation in patients with MPS I, II and VI who were previously deficient in Se.","Renata Bernardes de Oliveira1

The profiling of the genes showed a significant increase in STX1A and VAMP2 expression (p < 0.001) in high-grade tumor cells compared to normal and low-grade tumors. These findings suggest that elevated expression of STX1A and VAMP2 might have caused the abnormal progression and invasion of cancer cells leading to the transformation of cells into high-grade tumor in bladder cancer.","Syed Tahir Abbas Shah1

We tested cross-genera SSR amplification in the family Cactaceae using a total of 20 heterologous primers previously developed for the genera Ariocarpus, Echinocactus, Polaskia and Pilosocereus, in four taxa of the genus Cereus: C. fernambucensis subsp. fernambucensis, C. fernambucensis subsp. sericifer, C. jamacaru and C. insularis. Nine microsatellite loci were amplified in Cereus resulting in 35.2% of success in transferability, which is higher than the average rate of 10% reported in the literature for cross-genera transferability in eudicots. The genetic variation in the transferred markers was sufficient to perform standard clustering analysis, indicating each population as a cohesive genetic cluster. Overall, the amount of genetic variation found indicates that the transferred SSR markers might be useful in large-scale population studies within the genus Cereus.","Gislaine Angélica Rodrigues Silva1

The genotypes of three SNPs (rs9722, rs881827 and rs1051169) in S100B gene were detected by single base extension polymerase chain reaction (SBE-PCR). Serum S100B levels were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Rs1051169 was associated with an increased risk of SLE (C vs. G: adjusted OR=1.46, 95% CI, 1.18-1.80, p=0.001; CC vs. GG: adjusted OR=1.99, 95% CI, 1.32-3.02, p=0.001; CC+GC vs. GG: adjusted OR=1.54, 95% CI, 1.13-2.11, p=0.007; CC vs. GC+GG: adjusted OR=1.67, 95% CI, 1.16-2.42, p=0.006). Haplotype analysis showed that the G-G-C haplotype was associated with an increased risk of SLE (OR=1.50, 95% CI, 1.14-1.98, p=0.004). Stratified analyses showed that the rs1051169 polymorphism was associated with an increased risk of neurologic disorder in SLE patients (C vs. G: OR=1.78, 95% CI, 1.22-2.59, p=0.003; GC vs. GG: OR=2.33, 95% CI, 1.14-4.77, P=0.019; CC vs. GG: OR=3.02, 95% CI, 1.39-6.53, p=0.004; CC+GC vs. GG: OR=2.57, 95% CI=1.31-5.04, p=0.005). In addition, SLE patients with neurologic disorder carrying the rs1051169 GC/CC genotypes present a higher serum S100B levels compared with that carrying the GG genotype (p < 0.05). Our results indicate that the rs1051169 polymorphism may be involved in the pathogenesis of SLE.","Chunhong Liu1
