We detected HPV16/18 infection in 43 normal cervical tissues, 30 cervical intraepithelial neoplasia lesions (CIN) and 48 cervical cancer tissues with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method. Methylation in the promoter regions of the WT1, NKX6-1 and DBC1 genes in the above-mentioned tissues was measured by methylation-specific PCR (MSP) and cloning sequencing. The expression level of these three genes was measured by real-time PCR (qPCR) in 10 methylation-positive cervical cancer tissues and 10 methylation-negative normal cervical tissues. We found that the infection of HPV16 in normal cervical tissues, CIN and cervical cancer tissues was 14.0, 36.7 and 66.7%, respectively. The infection of HPV18 was 0, 6.7 and 10.4%, respectively. The methylation rates of WT1, NKX6-1 and DBC1 genes were 7.0, 11.6 and 23.3% in normal cervical tissues, 36.7, 46.7 and 30.0% in CIN tissues, and 89.6, 77.1 and 85.4% in cervical cancer tissues. Furthermore, WT1, NKX6-1 and DBC1 genes were hypermethylated in the high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (CIN2, CIN3) and in the cervical cancer tissues with infection of HPV16/18 (both P< 0.05). The expression of WT1, NKX6-1 and DBC1 was significantly lower in the methylation-positive cervical cancer tissues than in methylation-negative normal cervical tissues. Our findings indicated that methylation in the promoter regions of WT1, NKX6-1 and DBC1 is correlated with cervical cancer tumorigenesis in Uygur women.

GSTM1 null genotype was significantly more frequent in atherosclerotic patients than in controls (52.0% vs 34.1%) and individuals with the GSTM1 null genotype had an approximately 2-fold increase in atherosclerosis risk (OR: 2.1, 95%CI=1.39-3.17, P=0.0004). GSTT1 null genotype alone did not show a statistically significant effect on atherosclerosis risk modulation, but the association approached significance (OR: 1.57, 95%CI=0.94-2.64, P=0.08). The combined analysis showed that the presence of both genes had a protective effect against atherosclerosis (OR=0.55, 95%CI=0.37-0.83, P=0.005) while double null genotypes led to a robust atherosclerosis risk increase (OR: 8.14, 95%CI= 2.41-27.51, P < 0.0001). This study demonstrated that the GSTM1 null and combined GSTM1/GSTT1 null genotypes are susceptibility factors for development of atherosclerosis in a Serbian population.","Nada Vucinic1

In the comet test, MMS induced genotoxic effects at all the concentrations in the evaluated accessions of rice and beans, except in one accession of beans at the lowest concentration (5 mg/L).

Character optimizations revealed that the common ancestor of sect. Viperella was probably diploid (2n = 2x =18) with two subsequent polyplodization events. Total DNA content (2C) varied considerably across the phylogeny with larger genomes detected mainly in polyploid species. Altitude also varied across the phylogeny, however no significant relationship was found between DNA content changes and altitude in our data set. All taxa presented regular meiosis and pollen viability (> 87%), except for S. sp. nov. aff. alatum (22.70%), suggesting a recent hybrid origin. Chromosome number is mostly constant within this section and polyploidy is the only source of modification. Although 2C varied considerably among the 20 taxa investigated, the diversity observed cannot be attributed only to polyploidy events because large variations of DNA content were also observed among diploids.","Olivier Chauveau3

We detected a close relationship between the amount of Mn and the abundance of Pseudomonadales in ‘Obatã’ and the amount of Ca and the abundance of Enterobacteriales in C. canephora. We suggest that mineral nutrients can be key drivers that shape leaf microbial communities.","Jorge Maurício Costa Mondego1

Although inborn errors of metabolism (IEMs) are monogenic diseases, genotype alone is not enough to explain the wide phenotypic variability observed in patients with these conditions. Genetics and diet exert a strong influence on the microbiome, and diet is used (alone or as an adjuvant) in the treatment of many IEMs. This review will describe how the effects of the microbiome on the host can interfere with IEM phenotypes through interactions with organs such as the liver and brain, two of the structures most commonly affected by IEMs. The relationships between treatment strategies for some IEMs and the microbiome will also be addressed. Studies on the microbiome and its influence in individuals with IEMs are still incipient, but are of the utmost importance to elucidating the phenotypic variety observed in these conditions.","Ida Vanessa Doederlein Schwartz1

Although inborn errors of metabolism (IEMs) are monogenic diseases, genotype alone is not enough to explain the wide phenotypic variability observed in patients with these conditions. Genetics and diet exert a strong influence on the microbiome, and diet is used (alone or as an adjuvant) in the treatment of many IEMs. This review will describe how the effects of the microbiome on the host can interfere with IEM phenotypes through interactions with organs such as the liver and brain, two of the structures most commonly affected by IEMs. The relationships between treatment strategies for some IEMs and the microbiome will also be addressed. Studies on the microbiome and its influence in individuals with IEMs are still incipient, but are of the utmost importance to elucidating the phenotypic variety observed in these conditions.","Ida Vanessa Doederlein Schwartz1

We identified 211 ABA-dependent differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and 1,118 ABA-independent DEGs under drought stress. Functional analysis showed that ABA-dependent DEGs were significantly enriched in expected biological processes in response to water deprivation and ABA stimulus, while ABA-independent DEGs were preferentially enriched in response to jasmonic acid (JA), salicylic acid (SA) and gibberellin (GA) stimuli. We found significantly enriched interactions between ABA-dependent and ABA-independent pathways with 94 genes acting as core interacting components by combining network analyses. A link between ABA and JA signaling mediated through a direct interaction of the ABA responsive elements-binding factor ABF3 with the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor MYC2 was validated by yeast two-hybrid and bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assays. Our study provides a systematic view of the interplay between ABA-dependent and ABA-independent pathways in response to drought stress.","Yihui Liu1

Here we describe the N. cinerea fat body and head transcriptome, in order to provide a database of genetic sequences to better understand the metabolic role of these tissues, and describe detoxification and stress response genes. After removing low-quality sequences, we obtained 62,121 transcripts, of which more than 50% had a length of 604 pb. The assembled sequences were annotated according to their genes ontology (GO). We identified 367 genes related to stress and detoxification; among these, the more frequent were p450 genes.

Nauphoeta cinerea is one of the species that has been studied, and among its advantages is its easy laboratory maintenance. However, a limited amount of genetic data about N. cinerea is available, impeding gene identification and expression analyses, genetic manipulation, and a deeper understanding of its functional biology. Here we describe the N. cinerea fat body and head transcriptome, in order to provide a database of genetic sequences to better understand the metabolic role of these tissues, and describe detoxification and stress response genes. After removing low-quality sequences, we obtained 62,121 transcripts, of which more than 50% had a length of 604 pb. The assembled sequences were annotated according to their genes ontology (GO). We identified 367 genes related to stress and detoxification; among these, the more frequent were p450 genes. The results presented here are the first large-scale sequencing of N. cinerea and will facilitate the genetic understanding of the species' biochemistry processes in future works.","Elgion Lucio Silva Loreto1

In addition, an association between the CTLA-4 G/G genotype and obesity was detected in TS patients (p=0.02, OR=6.04). Regarding, the -550(H/L) polymorphism in the MBL2 promoter, the frequency of the H/L genotype was significantly higher in the TS group than healthy controls (p=0.01, OR=1.96).

Molecular screening of the GJB2, GJB6 and MTRNR1 genes in the proband showed no alterations; however, whole exome sequencing detected a heterozygous mutation, c.1099C > T (p.Arg367*), in the GATA3 gene. Segregation analyses showed that the mother also had the mutation, but not the grandparents, hence indicating a different hearing impairment type for the grandfather. Paternity test of the mother of the proband confirmed that she has a de novo mutation. Furthermore, HDR syndrome was confirmed with new clinical evaluations showing right kidney agenesis in the proband. This is the first study reporting only deafness and renal abnormalities as symptoms of the p.Arg367* mutation in the GATA3 gene, and also the sixth HDR syndrome case in the world, and the first on the American continent. Together with other reported cases, this study highlights the variability of HDR syndrome symptoms in individuals with the p.Arg367* mutation, emphasizing the importance of molecular analyses for correct diagnosis.","Edi Lúcia Sartorato1

Scientific evidence corroborates the ethnomedicinal use of the oil of pequi (Caryocar brasiliense Camb.), a typical Brazilian Cerrado fruit, against oxidative damage to biomolecules and inflammation. We aimed to investigate in vivo the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects of pequi oil on hemogram and DNA damage in healthy young adult and older middle-aged Swiss mice of both genders. Animals, aged 6-7 and 11-12 months, were orally treated for 15 days with pequi oil at 30 mg/day. Blood samples were used for hemogram and comet assay, and bone marrow for micronucleus test. Female controls of 11-12 months had significantly lower haemoglobin and hematocrit than those of 6-7 months. Treatment with pequi oil improved this state, removing the differences. Pequi oil had no genotoxic or clastogenic effects and significantly increased lymphocytes and decreased neutrophils+monocytes in females of 11-12 months, removing the significant differences observed between controls of 6-7 and 11-12 months. The results suggest that dietary supplementation with pequi oil could protect against anemia, inflammation and oxidative stress related to aging, helping to prevent aging-related chronic degenerative diseases, mainly for females.","João Paulo Figueiró Longo1

The present study aimed to isolate and characterize adherent MSC-like populations from different tissues of Ctenomys minutus, a threatened wildlife rodent popularly known as tuco-tuco. Adherent cells were isolated from bone marrow, brain, liver, pancreas and adipose tissue of three adult animals collect in southern Brazil. Cultures showed typical morphology and proliferation potential. Adipose-derived MSCs showed trilineage potential. Cultures derived from adipose tissue, bone marrow and brain were immunophenotyped with negative results for CD31, CD44, CD45, CD106, and MHC class II, as well as strong positive results for CD29. Low fluorescence levels were seen for CD49d, CD90.2 and CD117. Cultures were negative for CD49e, except for brain-derived cultures that were weakly positive. CD11b was negative in adipose-derived MSCs, but positive in brain and bone marrow-derived cultures. The scratch assay showed high migration potential for pancreas and adipose tissue-derived cells. This study represents the first report of isolation and characterization of cultures having characteristics of MSCs from Ctenomys minutus. The collection of biological information for biobanks represents an important contribution to the creation of strategies for prevention of loss of genetic diversity.","Maiele Dornelles da Silveira1
